EIPMI
=====

EIPMI is a native Erlang/OTP application for RMCP/IPMI 1.5. It implements the
remote console part of the IPMI LAN interface, as specified
[here](http://www.intel.com/design/servers/ipmi/spec.htm). To provide a low
threshold for learning and using EIPMI it is designed close to the well known
`inet` API (think of `gen_udp`).

Contributing
------------

If you whish to contribute fixes or enhancements, please make your code look
nice, for example using the Emacs Erlang-mode, formatting your code before
committing. Also, you should always write proper `edoc` module documentation.
When writing documentation, please try to keep the tone simple and on a higher
abstraction level, so that users may understand the concepts without having to
know too much of the standard.

The modules `eipmi_request` and `eipmi_response` are a starting point for
developers that want add support for not yet implemented request/response pairs.
To add support for a new request the encoding of the corresponding IPMI data
part needs to be added to the `eipmi_request` module. To add support for a new
response the decoding of the corresponding IPMI data part needs to be added to
the `eipmi_response` module. As soon as encoding and decoding is implemented the
command is ready to be issued using `eipmi:raw/4`. For features that need to
combine multiple requests (e.g. reading the FRU) it would be even more nice to
add a corresponding frontend API function to the `eipmi` module.

Documentation
-------------

The following sections will give a brief description of the EIPMI features as
well as some usage examples for developers integrating the application into
their project. Additional information can be found in the projects EDoc/source
documentation. The EIPMI API functions are exported by the `eipmi` module.

### Sessions &amp; Authentication

EIPMI does all the necessary session handling for the user as soon as a session
is requested using `eipmi:open/1` or `eipmi:open/2`. However, according to the
capabilities of the target BMC the user eventually has to pass in user and
password credentials using the `Options` argument of `eipmi:open/2`. A user
process can immediatelly start using a session. All requests received before the
session is established will be queued and issued after the session is
established.

All authentication mechanisms mentioned in the specification are supported,
including *anonymous*, *null user* and *non-null user*. Additionally, all
digester algorithms proposed by the specification are supported.

In case the target BMC only supports *non-null* users the options `user` and
`password` need to be passed in a call to `eipmi:open/2`. In case *null users*
are configured on the BMC only the `password` option will be required. If the
BMC supports *anonymous* logins no options need to be set.

A session may be shared between mutliple processes. While the requests of one
process will be synchronous and thus ordered, requests from different processes
will not block each other. However, flow control is not performed by the session
and a user has to ensure that only a limited number of processes issue
concurrent requests over the same session.

The API of EIPMI has been designed to be as similar as possible to existing
erlang protocol implementations (e.g. `gen_udp`). Therefore, the session owner
(the process calling `open/1,2`) will get asynchronous messages for its
sessions. The messages are sent using ordinary Erlang messaging and should be
handled accordingly. Be prepared to receive the messages of the following form:

```erlang
{ipmi,
 Session :: eipmi:session(),
 Address :: inet:ip_address() | inet:hostname(),
 established}
```
The session was successfully established and activated.
```erlang
{ipmi,
 Session :: eipmi:session(),
 Address :: inet:ip_address() | inet:hostname(),
 {closed, Reason :: term()}}
```
The session was closed with the provided reason.
```erlang
{ipmi,
 Session :: eipmi:session(),
 Address :: inet:ip_address() | inet:hostname(),
 {decode_error, Reason :: term()}}
```
A received packet could not be decoded.
```erlang
{ipmi,
 Session :: eipmi:session(),
 Address :: inet:ip_address() | inet:hostname(),
 {timeout, {eipmi:request(), RqSeqNr :: 0..63}}}
```
The corresponding request timed out.
```erlang
{ipmi,
 Session :: eipmi:session(),
 Address :: inet:ip_address() | inet:hostname(),
 {unhandled, {call, Request :: term()}}}
```
The session received an invalid `gen_server` call.
```erlang
{ipmi,
 Session :: eipmi:session(),
 Address :: inet:ip_address() | inet:hostname(),
 {unhandled, {cast, Request :: term()}}}
```
The session received an invalid `gen_server` cast.
```erlang
{ipmi,
 Session :: eipmi:session(),
 Address :: inet:ip_address() | inet:hostname(),
 {unhandled, {info, Info :: term()}}}
```
The session received an invalid message.
```erlang
{ipmi,
 Session :: eipmi:session(),
 Address :: inet:ip_address() | inet:hostname(),
 SELEntry :: eipmi:sel_entry()}
```
A forwarded entry from the System Event Log (only when automatic SEL polling is
enabled).
```erlang
{ipmi,
 Session :: eipmi:session(),
 Address :: inet:ip_address() | inet:hostname(),
 {sel_read_error, Reason :: term()}}
```
An error occured when polling the System Event Log (only when automatic SEL
polling is enabled).

An established session will be kept alive by the session state machine until
either `eipmi:close/1` gets called or the owner process exits.

### Usage

The `eipmi` module contains the whole functionality this project currently has
to offer. It defines functions to manage sessions as well as functions to issue
implemented requests. Additionally it contains functions that abstract
functionality that usually need in-detail knowledge of the IPMI standard, e.g.
reading SDR or SEL entries.

The general process of session establishment is briefly outlined in the next
paragraphs. IPMI device discovery usually starts with a PING message to the
target host:

```erlang
case eipmi:ping("10.1.31.11") of
     pong ->
          ipmi_supported;
     pang ->
          ipmi_not_supported
end,
```

After successful device discovery an actual session can be opened. This example
will open a session, read the FRU with id 253 and close the session again.

```erlang
{ok, Session} = eipmi:open("10.1.31.11"),
{ok, {fru_data, FruInfo}} = eipmi:read_fru(Session, 253),
BoardArea = proplists:get_value(board_area, FruInfo),
Name = proplists:get_value(name, BoardArea),
Serial = proplists:get_value(serial_number, BoardArea),
error_logger:info_msg("Board ~s has serial number ~s.~n", [Name, Serial]),
eipmi:close(Session),
```

The following snippet first reads the BMC's Sensor Data Record Repository and
then returns the complete FRU inventory based on the found FRU Device Locator
Records.

```erlang
{ok, Session} = eipmi:open("10.1.31.11"),
{ok, SDRRepository} = eipmi:get_sdr_repository(Session),
{ok, FruInventory} = eipmi:read_fru_inventory(Session, SDRRepository),
error_logger:info_msg("FRU inventory:~n~p~n", [FruInventory]),
eipmi:close(Session),
```

EIPMI also allows to send *raw* requests over a session. However, raw does not
mean that binary data can be sent directly. The corresponding request/response
encode/decode functionality must be present. The following snippet will issue
the *Set Session Privilege Level* command, trying to set the current session
privilege to `administrator`.

```erlang
{ok, Response} = eipmi:raw(Session, 16#06, 16#3b, [{privilege, administrator}]),
NewPrivilege = proplists:get_value(privilege, Response),
error_logger:info_msg("New privilege level is ~p.~n", [NewPrivilege]),
```
